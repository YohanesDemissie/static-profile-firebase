          I wanted to create something useful, something that the every day small business owner can use to compete with
          major online corporations. I wanted to create something completely re-usable across all client, yet tailorable to
          personal preferences and specific business types.
        </p>
        <p class="projects-body">
          This is a generic online shopping application I created using React JS, Redux, Redux-Form, React-Router 4 and Node
          JS, interacting with a real api back end. In the React JS components, you can see I've excercised multiple ways to
          render the pages according to what I presume best practice.

        <h1 class="projects-title">Custom Funny Meme Creator</h1>
        <p class="projects-body">
          During football season, my fantasy group chats get really active with hilarious memes that can take some time to
          find the right one for the right moment. Searching for a meme, scrolling through options and picking the right one
          can take as a little as a few minutes. And in that time, a lot is missed in watching a live game. Some times
          intecerceptions, fumbles, trick plays and in overall, live ecitement is missed out on and we were spending too
          much time on our phones. </p>
        <p class="projects-body">I thought it would be funny and time efficient to just make my own app that allows a
          user to grab a funny image from top 100 funny memes, write their own custom jokes, and post to the group chat;
          spending less time on the phone and more time enjoying each others company, enjoy the game and live in the moment

        <p class="projects-body">
          Curious on how cross platform messenger apps work, I thought It would be really cool to look under the roof on how
          these apps are made. Now that the app is near exact replica of Slack, I want to incorporate video calling.
