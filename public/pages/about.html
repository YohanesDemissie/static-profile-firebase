        <p class="about-me-body">
          I've always had an admiration for intricate displays of art and aspired to be in a category of greatest creative
          orchestrators. I always wanted to create something so ahead of time, if not timeless, that will continue to
          flourish well beyond my time on this earth; a testimony of my legacy, if you will. I want people to look at my
          creation, flabbergasted in the level of imagination, grit and work ethic necessary to create something so
          revolutionary/iconic/jurassic. I want people to look at me the way the audience stared at the first iPhone, the
          first Tesla all electric automobile, the first artificial intelligent/machine learning chat bot. I want the world
          to look at me and my creations/accomplishments with unfathomable awe.

        <h1 class="about-me-title">Part 2: Tech Lifestyle/Platform</h1>
        <p class="about-me-body">
          Software engineering provides that platform and allows some of the most creative geniuses on earth to stand-out
          and stand tall next to their great(choose an other adjective with more dept) contribution towards a better world.
          The entire process of programming and developing moves me in ways I've never been aspired to
          achieve/pursuit(better word choice here). I love project meetings because you get to bounce ideas with such
          intelligent and creative people that expand the imagination, creativity, collective IQ, ambitious drive and
          excitement!

        <h1 class="about-me-title">Part 3: Infinite Possibilities</h1>
        <p class="about-me-body">
          I love finding solutions because of the numerous conclusions that keep me fully submerged in my work until the
          final product is complete and delivered to a more-than-satisfied client. And even then, theres always a better,
          more ways to to make a project better(say this part better). The entire process of coming up with something new
          and exciting, gathering ideas to make the best product we can, working day in and day out on the little things
          that make the bigger picture, and that proud feeling you get from all the little accomplishments from beginning to
          end makes every part of the process fresh, new and non-repetitive(this can be said better with pretty much not
          doing the same thing every day 9-5, non redundant, etc.)

        <h1 class="about-me-title">Part 4: Working as a team</h1>
        <p class="about-me-body">
          I love mob coding to collectively find innovative solutions. Like team meetings, great things come from geniuses
          alike but mob-coding is more focused on single solutions rather than the bigger picture, really allowing your team
          members to build (dynamic/genuine chemistry), learning and taking away each others strengths, and ultimately
          growing into a better team, organically.

        <p class="about-me-body">
          Ever since I wrote mh first line of code, I immediately saw the potential! My drive for greatness has discovered
          an outlet that, picked up the practice, fell in love with the lifestyle and haven't looked back since. I still
          remember my first time I launched my first site onto the browser, typed my name in an h1 tag and saw my name in
          big red letters. I was like a kid at magic show; my jaw dropped with fascination and wonder. After my first
          completed site, I knew this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

        <p class="about-me-body">
          In Conclusion my artistic admiration, infatuation with tech, joy in social practices and drive for greatness has
          catapulted/elevated(some dope finisher word) me into what I love and enjoy today, software engineering and
          development for a better world tomorrow.
